This guide emerged as a response to the growing adoption of SAFe by organisations lacking deep Agile experience. As Agile moved into the mainstream, decision-makers increasingly relied on vendor marketing and polished case studies, often without access to independent analysis or lessons learned from failed implementations.

Members of the Agile community created this guide to document the gap between SAFeâ€™s promises and its outcomes. Drawing from real-world case studies, practitioner feedback, and expert opinion, it provides a transparent, evidence-based resource to support informed decisions about scaling Agile.

This is title.
